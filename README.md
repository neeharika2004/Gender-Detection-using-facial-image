This is a gender detection project done using only Machine Learning. This was done with the help of Haar-cascade for facial feature extraction and SVM, KNN and Random Forest were used for gender detection. KNN was done by choosing the optimal k value using Grid Search algorithm. And KNN detects well for group images comopared to SVM and Random Forest.
This project was made to detect binary genders (male and female).
