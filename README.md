This is a gender detection project done using only Machine Learning. This was done with the help of Haar-cascade for facial feature extraction and SVM, KNN and Random Forest were used for gender detection. KNN was done by choosing the optimal k value using Grid Search algorithm. And KNN detects well for group images comopared to SVM and Random Forest.
OpenCV is used for live gender detection. Haarcascade files are used for extract features from them.
This project was made to detect binary genders (male and female).
